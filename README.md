^solid resource that explains a lot of how react is using partial views to provide content to the virtual DOM ***components***

#Major Issues
Understanding nvm - Node Version Manager. Getting set up is probably the hardest part but managed to get the correct version of node to work as well as the correct version of iojs.
I also had trouble with using xCode, used their beta version but it required a different version of osX so resorted to the standard version. Was able to that up and running but also ran into rode blocks of the emulater having trouble on my laptop.
Managed to get one version of my HelloWorld to appear but not completely. 
When running the inital command *react-native init AwesomeProject* my project did not include an AwesomeProject.xcodeproj file in the correct place; one existed but within the iOS folder that was created. 
^That was hard to troubleshoot because I wasnt sure if that was a version issue or not and it took time trying to find where it had created it.
Did successfully install react-native and get a better sense of what is required when making a native device.
